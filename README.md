# **Pizza Project**

### By _Brendan Grubb, 1/27/17_

## Description
Pizza Project is an application created to demonstrate my understanding of objects and their manipulation in JavaScript. This app is designed to mirror the act of ordering a pizza from a website. The user will be able to select a variety of options such as size and toppings to customize their pizza order. After that, they will be able to enter their personal information so the pizza can be delivered.
